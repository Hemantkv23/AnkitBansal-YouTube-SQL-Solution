Solution - 
1st Aproch -

WITH cte AS
(
SELECT gold AS player_name,'gold' AS medal_type FROM events 
UNION ALL
SELECT silver, 'silver' AS medal_type FROM events 
UNION ALL
SELECT bronze,'bronze' AS medal_type FROM events
)
SELECT player_name ,COUNT(1) AS no_of_gold
FROM cte
GROUP BY player_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT medal_type) = 1 AND max(medal_type)='gold'
ORDER BY player_name
;

2nd Aproch - 
SELECT  gold AS player_name, COUNT(id) AS no_of_gold
FROM events
WHERE gold NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT silver FROM events UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT bronze FROM events)
GROUP BY gold
ORDER BY gold;
